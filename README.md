## Introduction

NeuroWave is an open-source project aimed at developing a Configurable Neural Processing Core (CNP Core) for efficient neural network operations. We want to create a development ecosystem that allows users to easily create and visualize neural networks, and run them efficiently on our specialized NeuroWave PCIe cards.

## Roadmap

We have a Trello workspace to keep track of our roadmap, you can access it [here](https://trello.com/b/eZEVjjEK/neurowave)! Please note that the roadmap is unfinished, and currently only elaborates on items currently being worked on.

## Installation

Unfortunately our installation instructions are currently incomplete, however we will be updating them as soon as possible!

## Usage

Unfortunately our usage instructions are currently incomplete, however we will be updating them as soon as possible!

Please let me know if you would like to see a discord server for the project, if we gain enough interest I will set one up!

## Miscellaneous

NeuroWave is the name given to the project only, and not any form of branding. As such the name of the project may be subject to change, and the final software/hardware ecosystem will likely not have the same name. We intend for the NeuroWave project page to stay up even after completion. In the event that we are forced to change the name for unforseen reasons, we will do everything in our power to keep the project accessable. Additionally, upon completion of the project we will likely migrate the code to an official repository. This repository will have the same licensing and code, however it will be a more official page. When we reach this stage the new official repository will be linked in the README of the NeuroWave project.
